        English is a West Germanic Language originated in Anglo-Saxon England. It is the official language in 53 countries and is the preferred language of many international organizations. 
        The English Language is spoken by between 500 million and 1.8 billion people around the world and is widely recognized as the language of the business world.

        <p>
            The Western Healthcare Practices and Communication (WHPC) program at CPC includes additional communication skills along with professional healthcare refresher courses for experienced international healthcare professionals who plan to work in the Western healthcare industry.  
            Students are first taught English skills as needed to enter in the English speaking workplace.  Then additional communication skills consisting of resume writing, interview skills,
             and mock interviews are taught.
            The WHPC program provides foreign healthcare professionals with an introduction to healthcare in the United States.  
            Designed in conjunction with U.S. healthcare administrators, recruiters, nursing administrators, rehab specialists,
             physicians, and human resource personnel, this program introduces students to the singularity of the U.S. healthcare system.
            After successfully completing our WHPC program and receiving the WHPC Certification, the Occupational Practical Training (OPT) program,
             which is applied for through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS), will permit the nurse to work in a related field of training for a year.  
             After one year of work, they may qualify to continue working for a second year of OPT following another period of enrollment to achieve their Associates Degree in Health Science.  
             CPC has historically had a very high success rate in helping our students obtain OPT approval from U.S. immigration, after which we offer assistance for them in their search for OPT approved jobs at the end of their academic studies.
